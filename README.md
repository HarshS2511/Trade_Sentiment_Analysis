## 🔍 Key Insights

### Insight 1 — Fear Days = Higher (but Volatile) PnL
Average daily PnL is **$5,185 on Fear days vs $4,144 on Greed days**. However, Fear days show wider dispersion extreme winners pull the mean up while many traders lose. Median PnL is actually higher on Greed days ($265 vs $123), showing more consistent returns.

### Insight 2 — Traders Go Bigger & Longer During Fear
On Fear days, average position size is **$8,530 vs $5,955** on Greed days. Long/Short ratio is **2.45x during Fear vs 1.76x during Greed** traders aggressively buy dips, and it pays off when markets rebound.

### Insight 3 — High Frequency & Large Traders Win More
- High Frequency traders earn **3x more** ($10,713 avg PnL) than Low Frequency ($3,541)
- Large Traders earn **$9,324 avg PnL** vs $4,930 for Small Traders
- But Low Frequency traders have **higher win rates** (1.45 vs 1.16), suggesting consistency vs volume tradeoff

## 🚀 Strategy Recommendations

### Rule 1: "Fear = Opportunity for Large, Long-Biased Traders"
> During Fear days, high-capital accounts (avg size >$10K) should **increase long exposure**. The market overreacts to fear dip-buying strategies consistently outperform during these periods.

### Rule 2: "Greed Days = Trade Less, Trade Smarter"
> During Greed days, **reduce trade frequency** and focus on high-conviction setups only. Data shows fewer trades with better selectivity yields more consistent profits during bullish sentiment.

## 🤖 Bonus — Predictive Model
A **Logistic Regression** model trained on behavioral features (trade frequency, position size, win rate, long/short ratio, sentiment) achieves **90% accuracy** in predicting whether a trader will be profitable on a given day. Win rate and L/S ratio are the strongest predictors.
